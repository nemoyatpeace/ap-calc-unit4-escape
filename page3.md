# Page 3 — Unit 4: Rates of Change in Other Contexts (FRQ)

**Subtopic:** Interpreting rates of change in applied contexts (non-motion)

**Problem:**

The temperature T (in degrees Celsius) of a cooling cup of coffee is modeled by:

T(t) = 20 + 60e^(-0.08t)

where t is time in minutes after the coffee was poured.

**(a)** Find T'(t), the rate of change of temperature with respect to time.

**(b)** At what rate is the temperature changing at t = 10 minutes? Express your answer as a positive whole number of degrees per minute (rounded to nearest integer).

**(c)** At what time t is the temperature decreasing at a rate of 2 degrees Celsius per minute? Round your answer to the nearest whole number of minutes.

**Your navigation key:** Concatenate your answers from parts (b) and (c) with NO spaces:
- Part (b): The rate as a whole number (e.g., if 2.16°C/min, round to "2")
- Part (c): The time as a whole number (e.g., if 11.03 min, round to "11")
- Example format: if part (b) = 2 and part (c) = 11, then the key is "211"

## Escape Instructions:

**CRITICAL:** You must solve ALL parts (a), (b), and (c) to determine your navigation key.

1. Solve part (a) to find T'(t)
2. Solve part (b) - evaluate T'(10) and express as a POSITIVE whole number (round to nearest integer)
3. Solve part (c) - solve T'(t) = -2 for t, round to nearest integer
4. Concatenate parts (b) and (c) with no spaces: [answer_b][answer_c]
5. Navigate to: `https://nemoyatpeace.github.io/ap-calc-unit4-escape/[your_key].html`

**Example:** If you calculated T'(10) ≈ 2°C/min and t ≈ 11 minutes, your key would be "211"
