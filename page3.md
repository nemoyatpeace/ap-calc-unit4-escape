# Page 3 â€” Unit 4: Rates of Change in Other Contexts (FRQ)

**Subtopic:** Interpreting rates of change in applied contexts (non-motion)

**Problem:**

The temperature T (in degrees Celsius) of a cooling cup of coffee is modeled by:

T(t) = 20 + 60e^(-0.08t)

where t is time in minutes after the coffee was poured.

**(a)** Find T'(t), the rate of change of temperature with respect to time.

**(b)** Evaluate T'(10) and explain what this value represents in the context of the problem. Include proper units.

**(c)** At what time t is the temperature decreasing at a rate of 2 degrees Celsius per minute? Round your answer to 2 decimal places.

**Your final numeric answer for this page is your answer to part (c).**
