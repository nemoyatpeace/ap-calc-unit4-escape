## Problem

A farmer has 240 meters of fencing to enclose a rectangular field and divide it into two smaller rectangles by adding a fence parallel to one side of the rectangle. What dimensions maximize the total area enclosed?

- Define variables, write the area in terms of one variable
- Use calculus to find the maximum
- State the optimal dimensions and the maximum area

## Instructions
