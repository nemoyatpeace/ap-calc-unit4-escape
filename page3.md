# Page 3 — Unit 4: Product and Quotient Rules (FRQ)

Subtopic: Differentiation using product/quotient rules with evaluation

Problem:
Given f(x) = (2x^3 − 5x)·(x^2 + 4) and g(x) = (3x − 1)/(x^2 + 1):
- Compute f′(x) using the Product Rule, then evaluate f′(2).
- Compute g′(x) using the Quotient Rule, then evaluate g′(1).
- Your final numeric answer for this page is f′(2) + g′(1).

Escape Instructions (URL-based):
- Round your final value to 4 decimal places.
- Remove any commas or spaces.
- Your escape string is that value with a minus sign only if negative.
- Use the correct answer to navigate to the next page URL: page4.md.

Confirmation mechanic:
- If correct, page4.md will load and confirm you solved Page 3.
- If wrong, you won’t land on the correct next page.
