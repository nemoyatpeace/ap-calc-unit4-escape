# Page 2: Implicit Differentiation - Tangent Slope

## Problem

The curve is defined implicitly by x^2 + xy + y^2 = 7. At the point (2,1):

- Find dy/dx.
- Then find the slope of the tangent line at (2,1).

Show work using implicit differentiation.

## Instructions

After finding the slope m:

1. Round m to 4 decimal places
2. Your escape code is the absolute value of m multiplied by 10000
3. Enter this integer code to proceed to Page 3
