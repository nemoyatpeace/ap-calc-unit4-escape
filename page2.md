# Page 2 — Unit 4: Implicit Differentiation (FRQ)

Subtopic: Differentiation of relations defined implicitly

Problem:
The curve is defined implicitly by x^2 + xy + y^2 = 7. At the point (2,1):
- Find dy/dx using implicit differentiation.
- Evaluate the numeric slope at (2,1).

Escape Instructions (URL-based):
- Round the slope to 4 decimal places.
- Remove any commas or spaces.
- Your escape string is that value with a minus sign only if negative.
- Use the correct answer to navigate to the next page URL: page3.md.

Confirmation mechanic:
- If correct, page3.md will load and confirm you solved Page 2.
- If wrong, you won’t land on the correct next page.

Next: Navigate to page3.md after solving.
