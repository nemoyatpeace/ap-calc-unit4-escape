# Page 2 — Unit 4: Position, Velocity, and Acceleration (FRQ)

**Subtopic:** Motion analysis using derivatives

**Problem:**

A particle moves along a horizontal line. Its position (in meters) at time t (in seconds) is given by:

s(t) = t³ - 6t² + 9t + 2

for t ≥ 0.

**(a)** Find the velocity function v(t) and the acceleration function a(t).

**(b)** At what time(s) is the particle at rest? Show your work.

**(c)** Find the acceleration of the particle when t = 3 seconds.

**(d)** Is the particle speeding up or slowing down at t = 1 second? Justify your answer by examining the signs of velocity and acceleration.

**Your final numeric answer for this page is the acceleration at t = 3 (your answer to part c).**

## Escape Instructions (URL-based):

- Your final answer is a single number (the acceleration at t = 3).
- This should be an integer, so no decimal places needed.
- Remove any commas or spaces.
- Your escape string is that value with a minus sign only if negative.
- To navigate to the next page, simply proceed to page3.md.
