# Page 2 — Unit 4: Position, Velocity, and Acceleration (FRQ)

**Subtopic:** Motion analysis using derivatives

**Problem:**

A particle moves along a horizontal line. Its position (in meters) at time t (in seconds) is given by:

s(t) = t³ - 6t² + 9t + 2

for t ≥ 0.

**(a)** Find the velocity function v(t) and the acceleration function a(t).

**(b)** At what time(s) is the particle at rest? Show your work.

**(c)** Find the acceleration of the particle when t = 3 seconds.

**(d)** Is the particle speeding up or slowing down at t = 1 second? Justify your answer by examining the signs of velocity and acceleration.

**Your navigation key:** Concatenate your answers from parts (c) and (d) with NO spaces:
- Part (c): The acceleration value as a whole number (e.g., if 6, use "6")
- Part (d): Write "speedingup" if speeding up, "slowingdown" if slowing down, or "neither" if at rest
- Example format: if part (c) = 6 and part (d) = speeding up, then the key is "6speedingup"

## Escape Instructions:

**CRITICAL:** You must solve ALL parts (a), (b), (c), and (d) to determine your navigation key.

1. Solve part (a) to find v(t) and a(t)
2. Solve part (b) to find when the particle is at rest (you'll need this for part d)
3. Solve part (c) - express a(3) as a whole number
4. Solve part (d) - determine if speeding up or slowing down at t=1
   - At t=1: calculate v(1) and a(1)
   - If v and a have the same sign (both positive OR both negative), particle is speeding up
   - If v and a have opposite signs, particle is slowing down
   - If v=0, particle is at rest (transitioning)
5. Concatenate parts (c) and (d) with no spaces: [answer_c][answer_d]
6. Navigate to: `https://nemoyatpeace.github.io/ap-calc-unit4-escape/[your_key].html`

**Example:** If you calculated a(3) = 6 and determined the particle is speeding up at t=1, your key would be "6speedingup"
