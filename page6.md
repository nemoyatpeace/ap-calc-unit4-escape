# Page 6 â€” Unit 4: Approximations with Linearization (FRQ)

**Subtopic:** Linear approximation and tangent line approximations

**Problem:**

Let f(x) = âˆš(x + 1).

**(a)** Find f'(x), the derivative of f.

**(b)** Write the equation of the tangent line to f at x = 3. This tangent line is the linear approximation L(x) near x = 3.

**(c)** Use the linear approximation L(x) from part (b) to estimate f(3.2) = âˆš(4.2).

**(d)** Calculate the actual value of f(3.2) = âˆš(4.2) using a calculator, and find the absolute error |f(3.2) - L(3.2)|. Round both values to 4 decimal places.

**Your final numeric answer for this page is the absolute error from part (d), rounded to 4 decimal places.**
