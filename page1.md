# Page 1 — Unit 4: Interpreting the Derivative in Context (FRQ)

**Subtopic:** Understanding what the derivative represents in real-world contexts

**Problem:**

A water tank is being drained. The volume V (in gallons) of water remaining in the tank after t minutes is given by:

V(t) = 500 - 8t - 0.5t²

for 0 ≤ t ≤ 30.

**(a)** Find V'(t), the rate of change of volume with respect to time.

**(b)** Evaluate V'(10) and explain what this value represents in the context of the problem. Include proper units. Express your answer as a positive number (the rate at which water is leaving).

**(c)** At what time t is the water draining at a rate of 15 gallons per minute? Show your work.

**Your navigation key:** Concatenate your answers from parts (b) and (c) with NO spaces, NO decimal points, NO units:
- Part (b): The rate as a whole number (e.g., if 18.0 gal/min, use "18")
- Part (c): The time as a whole number (e.g., if 7.00 min, use "7")
- Example format: if part (b) = 18 and part (c) = 7, then the key is "187"

## Escape Instructions:

**CRITICAL:** You must solve ALL parts (a), (b), and (c) to determine your navigation key.

1. Solve part (a) to find the derivative function
2. Use part (a) to solve part (b) - express V'(10) as a POSITIVE whole number
3. Use part (a) to solve part (c) - express t as a whole number
4. Concatenate parts (b) and (c) with no spaces: [answer_b][answer_c]
5. Navigate to: `https://nemoyatpeace.github.io/ap-calc-unit4-escape/[your_key].html`

**Example:** If you calculated that V'(10) = 18 gallons/min and t = 7 minutes, your key would be "187"

Then navigate to: `https://nemoyatpeace.github.io/ap-calc-unit4-escape/187.html`

You're solving an escape room! Each page's filename IS the solution to the previous problem. You cannot skip ahead without solving the problem correctly. Work through the calculus carefully and check your algebra.
