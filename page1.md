# Page 1 — Unit 4: The Chain Rule (FRQ)

Subtopic: Differentiation using the Chain Rule in context

Problem:
A particle moves along a path where y = (3x^2 + 1)^(5/2). At x = 2,
- Compute dy/dx using the Chain Rule.
- Evaluate the numeric value at x = 2.

Escape Instructions (URL-based):
- Round your dy/dx value to 4 decimal places.
- Remove any commas or spaces.
- Your escape string is that value with a minus sign only if negative.
- Append it to the repository URL as the next page filename.
  Example: if your answer is 123.4567, go to page2.md (this page) by entering the URL for page2.md.

Confirmation mechanic:
- If your answer is correct, the next page (page2.md) will load successfully and confirm you solved Page 1.
- If it’s wrong, your URL will not match and you won’t land on the correct next page.

Next: Navigate to page2.md after solving.
