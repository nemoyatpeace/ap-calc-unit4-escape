# Page 1 — Unit 4: Interpreting the Derivative in Context (FRQ)

**Subtopic:** Understanding what the derivative represents in real-world contexts

**Problem:**

A water tank is being drained. The volume V (in gallons) of water remaining in the tank after t minutes is given by:

V(t) = 500 - 8t - 0.5t²

for 0 ≤ t ≤ 30.

**(a)** Find V'(t), the rate of change of volume with respect to time.

**(b)** Evaluate V'(10) and explain what this value represents in the context of the problem. Include proper units.

**(c)** At what time t is the water draining at a rate of 15 gallons per minute? Show your work.

**Your final numeric answer for this page is your answer to part (c) in minutes.**
