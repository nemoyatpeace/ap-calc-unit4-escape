# AP Calculus Unit 4 Escape Room

## Interactive FRQ Review Activities

Welcome to the AP Calculus Unit 4 Escape Room! This repository contains a series of Free Response Questions (FRQs) designed to help students review and master key concepts from Unit 4: Applications of Derivatives.

## Structure

The escape room consists of 6 pages, each focusing on a different Unit 4 topic:

1. **Page 1**: Interpreting the Derivative in Context
2. **Page 2**: Position, Velocity, and Acceleration
3. **Page 3**: Rates of Change in Other Contexts
4. **Page 4**: Related Rates (Balloons)
5. **Page 5**: Related Rates (Coney Island)
6. **Page 6**: Approximations with Linearization

## How It Works

Each page contains:
- A multi-part FRQ problem
- Clear instructions for solving
- An "escape" mechanic: solve the problem to unlock the next page
- Guidance on the mathematical concepts being tested

Students should work through each page sequentially, solving the calculus problems and using their answers to navigate to the next challenge.

## Topics Covered

This escape room aligns with AP Calculus AB/BC Unit 4 learning objectives, including:
- Interpretation of derivatives in real-world contexts
- Motion problems (position, velocity, acceleration)
- Related rates problems
- Linear approximation and tangent lines

## Getting Started

Begin with [page1.md](page1.md) and work your way through each problem. Show all your work and check your answers carefully!

Good luck, and happy calculating! ðŸ“Š
