# AP Calculus Unit 4 Escape Room

## Interactive FRQ Review Activities

Welcome to the AP Calculus Unit 4 Escape Room! This repository contains a series of Free Response Questions (FRQs) designed to help students review and master key concepts from Unit 4: Applications of Derivatives.

**IMPORTANT:** This escape room has been redesigned so that **each page's filename IS the solution to the previous problem**. You cannot skip ahead without solving each problem correctly!

## Structure

The escape room consists of 6 sequential problems:

1. **Page 1** (start: page1.md): Interpreting the Derivative in Context
2. **Page 2** (solution-based filename): Position, Velocity, and Acceleration  
3. **Page 3** (solution-based filename): Rates of Change in Other Contexts
4. **Page 4** (solution-based filename): Related Rates (Balloons)
5. **Page 5** (solution-based filename): Related Rates (Coney Island)
6. **Page 6** (solution-based filename): Approximations with Linearization

## How It Works - UPDATED!

Each page now contains:
- A multi-part FRQ problem where **ALL parts must be solved**
- Clear instructions for creating your navigation key by **concatenating answers**
- The next page URL format: `https://nemoyatpeace.github.io/ap-calc-unit4-escape/[your_solution_key].html`
- Guidance on the mathematical concepts being tested

**Example:** If a problem asks you to:
- Find the rate (part b) = 18 gallons/min
- Find the time (part c) = 7 minutes
- Your navigation key would be "187"
- Navigate to: `https://nemoyatpeace.github.io/ap-calc-unit4-escape/187.html`

You **cannot guess** or skip ahead - the HTML files are named based on the correct mathematical solutions!

## Topics Covered

This escape room aligns with AP Calculus AB/BC Unit 4 learning objectives, including:
- Interpretation of derivatives in real-world contexts
- Motion problems (position, velocity, acceleration)
- Related rates problems
- Linear approximation and tangent lines

## Getting Started

Begin with [page1.md](page1.md) and work through the problem carefully. You must solve ALL parts of the first problem to determine the URL of the second page.

Good luck, and happy calculating! ðŸ“Š

## Solutions Map (For Instructors)

The complete navigation path is:
1. Start at `page1.md`
2. Solve to get key "187" â†’ Navigate to `187.html`
3. Solve to get key "6speedingup" â†’ Navigate to `6speedingup.html`  
4. Solve to get key "211" â†’ Navigate to `211.html`
5. Solve to get key "72226" â†’ Navigate to `72226.html`
6. (Continue pattern for remaining pages)

Note: Solution-named HTML files must be created from the corresponding markdown files for the escape room to function properly.
