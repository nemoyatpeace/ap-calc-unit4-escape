# Page 5 â€” Unit 4: Related Rates (Coney Island) (FRQ)

**Subtopic:** Related rates with distance and position

**Problem:**

Two people are walking on the Coney Island boardwalk. Person A starts at the origin and walks north along the y-axis at 3 feet per second. Person B starts at the point (0, 40) and walks east along the line y = 40 at 4 feet per second.

**(a)** Write expressions for the positions of Person A and Person B at time t seconds. Person A's position is (0, y_A(t)) and Person B's position is (x_B(t), 40).

**(b)** Let D(t) represent the distance between the two people at time t. Using the distance formula, write an expression for D(t) in terms of t.

**(c)** Find dD/dt, the rate at which the distance between them is changing.

**(d)** Evaluate dD/dt when t = 5 seconds. Round your answer to 2 decimal places.

**Your final numeric answer for this page is your answer to part (d) in feet per second.**
