# Page 4 — Unit 4: Related Rates (Balloons) (FRQ)

**Subtopic:** Related rates with volume and radius

**Problem:**

A spherical balloon is being inflated. The volume V of a sphere with radius r is given by:

V = (4/3)πr³

Suppose the radius is increasing at a constant rate of 0.5 cm per second.

**(a)** Use the chain rule to find dV/dt in terms of r and dr/dt.

**(b)** At the instant when the radius is 6 cm, how fast is the volume increasing? Express your answer in terms of π.

**(c)** Calculate the numeric value of your answer from part (b) using π ≈ 3.14159. Round to 2 decimal places.

**Your final numeric answer for this page is your answer to part (c) in cubic cm per second.**
