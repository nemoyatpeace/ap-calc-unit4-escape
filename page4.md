# Page 4 — Unit 4: Related Rates (Balloons) (FRQ)

**Subtopic:** Related rates with volume and radius

**Problem:**

A spherical balloon is being inflated. The volume V of a sphere with radius r is given by:

V = (4/3)πr³

Suppose the radius is increasing at a constant rate of 0.5 cm per second.

**(a)** Use the chain rule to find dV/dt in terms of r and dr/dt.

**(b)** At the instant when the radius is 6 cm, how fast is the volume increasing? Express your answer in terms of π as a coefficient (e.g., "72pi"). 

**(c)** Calculate the numeric value of your answer from part (b) using π ≈ 3.14159. Round to the nearest whole number of cubic cm per second.

**Your navigation key:** Concatenate your answers from parts (b) and (c) with NO spaces:
- Part (b): The coefficient of π (e.g., if 72π, use "72")
- Part (c): The numeric value as a whole number (e.g., if 226.19, round to "226")
- Example format: if part (b) = 72π and part (c) = 226, then the key is "72226"

## Escape Instructions:

**CRITICAL:** You must solve ALL parts (a), (b), and (c) to determine your navigation key.

1. Solve part (a) to find the related rates formula
2. Solve part (b) - express dV/dt in the form kπ where k is an integer
3. Solve part (c) - calculate the numeric value and round to nearest integer
4. Concatenate parts (b) and (c) with no spaces: [answer_b][answer_c]
5. Navigate to: `https://nemoyatpeace.github.io/ap-calc-unit4-escape/[your_key].html`

**Example:** If you calculated dV/dt = 72π ≈ 226 cm³/sec, your key would be "72226"
